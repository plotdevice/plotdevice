NodeBox 1.9.6
=============
NodeBox is an application used in graphic design research. It provides
an interactive Python environment where you can create two-dimensional
graphics. NodeBox scripts can create PDFs or QuickTime movies that can 
contain anything from simple geometrical shapes to fully-fledged bitmaps,
vector images and text.

NodeBox is mostly meant to design and explore generative design and
animation. It features several ways to manipulate parameters inside 
of a program: it contains an interface builder and an on-the-fly value 
changing gizmo called the throttle.

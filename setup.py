# This is your standard setup.py, so to install the module & command line tool, use:
#     python setup.py install
#
# In addition to the `install' command, there are a few other variants:
#
#    app:    builds ./dist/PlotDevice.app using Xcode
#    py2app: builds the application using py2app
#    clean:  discard anything already built and start fresh
#    build:  puts the module in a usable state. after building, you should be able
#            to run the ./app/plotdevice command line tool within the source distribution.
#            If you're having trouble building the app, this can be a good way to sanity
#            check your setup
#
# We require some dependencies:
# - Mac OS X 10.9+
# - py2app or xcode or just pip
# - PyObjC (should be in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras)
# - cPathMatics, cGeo, cIO, cEvent, & polymagic (included in the "app/deps" folder)
# - Sparkle.framework (auto-downloaded only for `dist` builds)

DESCRIPTION = "Create two-dimensional graphics and animations with code"
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """PlotDevice is a Macintosh application used for computational graphic design. It provides an
interactive Python environment where you can create two-dimensional graphics
and output them in a variety of vector, bitmap, and animation formats. It is
meant both as a sketch environment for exploring generative design and as a
general purpose graphics library for use in stand-alone Python programs.

PlotDevice is a fork of NodeBox 1.9.7rc1 with support for modern versions of
Python and Mac OS.

The new version features:

* Enhanced command line interface.
* New text editor with tab completion, syntax color themes, and emacs/vi bindings.
* Video export in H.264 or animated gif formats (with GCD-based i/o).
* Added support for external editors by reloading the source when changed.
* Build system now works with Xcode or ``py2app`` for the application and ``pip`` for the module.
* Virtualenv support (for both installation of the module and running scripts with dependencies).
* External scripts can use ``from plotdevice import *`` to create a drawing environment.
* Simplified bezier & affine transform api using the python ‘with’ statement
* New compositing operations for blend mode, global opacity, and dropshadows
* Simplified typography commands with stylesheet-based character styles
* Now uses the system's Python 2.7 interpreter.

Requires:

* Mac OS X 10.9+

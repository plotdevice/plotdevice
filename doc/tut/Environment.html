    <p>PlotDevice is a Mac OS X application in which you can write Python scripts, programming
    code, that produces visual output you can save as a PDF, an image or a Quicktime movie <a href="Animation.html">animation</a>. Each script opened in PlotDevice has a separate window divided
    into three parts.</p>
    <p><br/>
    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="525" src="../etc/tut/environment1.jpg" width="580"/></span></p>
    <h2>Code, output, and messages</h2>

    <p>The three parts are for code, output, and messages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <strong>code</strong> you write goes in the top right area. Any keywords are
        automatically colored (for example, all of the PlotDevice commands in <a href="../manual.html">the reference</a>).</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Once you have a script going, you can press <em>apple-R</em> to have PlotDevice examine
        your script and generate visual <strong>output</strong>, in the left area. Don’t hesitate
        to press <em>apple-r</em> as often as you like, seeing what output your script produces is
        the best way to learn what it does.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>The lower right area is for <strong>messages</strong>: remarks that PlotDevice has about
        any errors in your script, or any output from the <em>print</em> command. PlotDevice isn’t
        very bright when it comes to analysing your code - it’s a computer program, and only
        recognises commands and statements when they are written in exactly the right way (or
        <em>syntax</em>).</p></li>
      </ul>

    <p>Errors in scripts are common, and you will encounter a lot of them at first. Errors are an
    unavoidable part of the programmatic design process. Don’t let them discourage you - instead,
    find out what is going wrong in your script so you won’t make the same mistake next time.</p>
    <h2>Exporting</h2>

    <p>Once you are satisfied with the output of your script, you can export it to one or more
    PDF’s or images: press <em>apple-E</em> (or choose Export to Image from the File menu). Here
    you can select the number of pages you want to export. Each page results in a separate PDF or
    image document. For each page, PlotDevice reruns the script - this is especially useful if your
    script contains <a href="../ref/Utility.html#random()">random()</a> commands, since the output
    will then be different for each page.</p>
    <p><br/>
    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="520" src="../etc/tut/environment2.jpg" width="574"/></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>A multiple-page export of this example script generates random output. This is an important
    part of the PlotDevice-philosophy: you define the general <em>style</em> of the output in your
    script, while having the option to retain a range of freedom in which choices are left up to
    PlotDevice. In this way, you can quickly develop a consistent style that looks different each
    time, quickly test and asses your creations.</p>
    <p>A different composition of ovals could be used on each page, with the same ease as creating
    only a single page:</p>

    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls6.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls7.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls8.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls9.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls10.jpg" width="132"/></span>
    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls11.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls12.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls13.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls14.jpg" width="132"/></span>
    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls15.jpg" width="132"/></span> <span class="media"><img alt="" height="132" src="../etc/tut/environment-balls16.jpg" width="132"/></span></p>
    <p><br/>
    PDF documents can be opened in Adobe Illustrator (for example), where you can ungroup the
    composition and transform and scale the individual elements without loss of quality.</p>
    <h2>Saving</h2>

    <p>When you save your work, you save the script, not the output. In fact, you save the
    <em>recipe</em> or template style. You can open your script again later on, make changes, or
    apply it to different shapes or images for example. The script is a piece of your
    way-of-working stored on disk. Moreover, the script takes much less space on disk than the
    actual output.</p>
    <h2>The coordinate system</h2>

    <p>When you place an element on the canvas, you define its positions in terms of <em>x</em> and
    <em>y</em> coordinates. The <em>x</em> is the horizontal position measured from the left of the
    canvas, the <em>y</em> the vertical position measured from the top.</p>
    <p>PlotDevice has an inverted coordinate system which might be confusing to DrawBot users. In
    math <em>going down</em> would mean that <em>y</em> becomes negative, while in PlotDevice
    <em>y</em> gets bigger. I think this keeps things comprehensible when creating page layouts;
    because pages work from top to bottom as well.</p>
    <p><br/>
    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="520" src="../etc/tut/environment3.jpg" width="574"/></span></p>
    <h2>Throttle</h2>

    <p>The throttle appears when you click the mouse on any numeric value in your script while
    pressing down the apple-key. Drag the mouse left and right to decrease or increase the value.
    Values increase or decrease by 1, unless you hold down the shift-key as well, in which case the
    increment will be 0.1 - or you can hold down the alt-key for increments by 10.</p>
    <p><br/>
    <span class="media"><img alt="" height="57" src="../etc/tut/throttle.gif" width="195"/></span></p>
    <h2>Interrupt a running script</h2>

    <p>Sometimes a running script takes a long time to render it’s output. You can then stop
    PlotDevice by pressing command-period. PlotDevice will still render the partially finished
    output.</p>

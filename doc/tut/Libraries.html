    <p>PlotDevice can be extended with a wealth of functionality (for example, Google queries, or
    image manipulation) by importing the right external libraries. All of these tools are kept
    apart from PlotDevice for the simple reason that it would make PlotDevice to unwieldy and
    complex if they would all be included.</p>
    <h2>Libraries from the PlotDevice site</h2>

    <p>The PlotDevice site has a lot of interesting libraries developed in and for PlotDevice, for
    example <a href="../lib/WordNet.html">WordNet</a> functionality, or <a href="../lib/Core_Image.html">Core Image</a>, which offers PhotoShop-like commands. A list of all
    libraries is <a href="Library">here</a>.</p>
    <p>To use one of these libraries, you first need to download it to your computer. Then, you
    need to put the files somewhere where your PlotDevice script can find them: <strong>in the same
    folder as your PlotDevice script</strong> or <strong>in the Application Support folder</strong>
    <em>(~/Library/Application Support/PlotDevice/).</em></p>
    <p>Then, import the library into your script with the <strong>ximport()</strong> command.</p>
    <p>Notice how the <em>wordnet.py</em> library and the <em>pywordnet</em> folder (both came from
    the WordNet download) are in the same folder as the <em>dictionary.py</em> script (which we
    just created):</p>

    <h2>Python libraries</h2>

    <p>The scripts you write in PlotDevice is in fact <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
    code. Since Python is installed on your Mac by default, you can access and import all of
    Python’s libraries in your PlotDevice projects.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the list of Python libraries <a href="http://docs.python.org/modindex.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>You can import a library command into your script with the following statement:<br/></p>
<pre>variable <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">ximport</span>(<span class="s">"library"</span>)
</pre>

    <p>For example, if you look at the <em>random</em> library on the above list of Python
    libraries, you see the <em>random</em> library has a <em>shuffle()</em> command to randomly
    reorder a <a href="Lists.html">list</a>. To use this command in a PlotDevice project:</p>
<pre>
<span class="nb">list</span> <span class="o">=</span> [<span class="mi">1</span>, <span class="mi">2</span>, <span class="mi">3</span>, <span class="mi">4</span>, <span class="mi">5</span>]
rnd <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">ximport</span>(<span class="s">"random"</span>)
rnd<span class="o">.</span>shuffle(<span class="nb">list</span>) 
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="nb">list</span>  
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> [<span class="mi">3</span>, <span class="mi">4</span>, <span class="mi">1</span>, <span class="mi">5</span>, <span class="mi">2</span>]
</pre>

    <p>You don’t need to install any files or anything, PlotDevice knows where the Python libraries
    are.</p>
    <h2>For techies: why the ximport() command?</h2>

    <p>We prefer <em>ximport()</em> over the <em>import</em> statement, because it takes away a
    step of having to explain why all commands have brackets, but not <em>import</em>. Furthermore,
    <em>ximport()</em> passes the drawing context to a referenced library so that library can draw
    stuff to the screen.</p>
    <p>But for standard Python libraries, you can still use <em>import</em> and <em>from a import
    b</em> if you like.</p>

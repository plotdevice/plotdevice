    <p>The <em>drawing primitives</em> are the basic shapes available in NodeBox: rectangles,
    ovals, lines, curves, text and images. It's a small set of programming
    <strong>commands</strong> that is easy to use and easy to understand which you can use to
    create visual output in NodeBox. The <a href="Reference">reference</a> is all about the drawing
    primitives: each of the commands and their usage is discussed thoroughly there. The reference
    is something you'll want to keep close by when you start learning NodeBox. After a bit of
    experimenting you'll know all the drawing primitives by heart.</p>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    <p>Take a look at the <a href="../ref/Primitives.html#rect()">rect()</a> command for example.
    This command (logically) draws a rectangle in NodeBox. You'll see a description of it's
    <em>syntax</em>, in other words, how exaclty you need to write down the command in NodeBox for
    it to work.</p>
    <p>In case of the rect() command the syntax is:</p>
    <pre><span class="kw">rect</span><span class="s">(</span>x, y, width, height, roundness=<span class="s">0.0</span>, draw=<span class="kw">True</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>


    <p>All commands in NodeBox look like this: you have the <strong>name</strong> of the command
    (<em>rect</em> for example) which gives you a hint of what the command will do, and some stuff
    <strong>between brackets</strong>. The stuff between brackets we call
    <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Parameters</h2>

    <p>Now <em>rectangle</em> could mean a lot of things. Imagine a rectangle with an equal width
    and height, this would be a square. We could have a <em>square()</em> command in NodeBox.
    Imagine you would like a small rectangle at the bottom of the canvas... we could have a
    <em>smallbottomrect()</em> command... we could define an infinite number of commands for
    rectangles in all sizes and flavors!</p>
    <p>Instead of defining a tangle of commands, there is a single rect() command with
    <em>parameters</em>. Parameters are things you can customize. You can supply numbers, <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>, <a href="Strings.html">strings</a> and other things as
    parameters to a command to have it look exactly the way you want it to.</p>
    <p>For example, to draw a square in the top left of the canvas:</p>
    <pre><span class="kw">rect</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">0</span>, <span class="s">0</span>, <span class="s">40</span>, <span class="s">40</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>


    <p>Notice how we replaced the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> from
    the syntax description with real numbers. These number parameters describe how our rectangle
    will look: it is positioned in the top left (x is 0 and y is 0) and has an equal width and
    height of 40.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="media"><img alt="" height="515" src="media/primitives1.jpg" width="577"/></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Optional parameters</h2>

    <p>You'll notice some other parameters in the rect() syntax which we didn't define, the
    <em>roundness=0.0</em> for example. If a parameter description has an <em>=something</em> next
    to it, this means it is optional. If we don't define this parameter in our script, it's default
    value is <em>something</em>. In case of the rectangle command, the corner roundness is 0 by
    default, unless we explicitly say:</p>
    <pre><span class="kw">rect</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">0</span>, <span class="s">0</span>, <span class="s">40</span>, <span class="s">40</span>, roundness=<span class="s">0.5</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>


    <p>Now we have a rectangle with 50% round corners.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="media"><img alt="" height="513" src="media/primitives2.jpg" width="583"/></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Throttle</h2>

    <p>The reference describes what kind of values you can use for each parameter in each command.
    If these are numbers, you can use the <em>throttle</em> to quickly change them, as described in
    the <a href="Environment.html">environment</a> tutorial. This is an easy way to play around
    with number parameters.</p>
    <h2>Defining your own commands</h2>

    <p>It's not that difficult to create your own commands in NodeBox, in the <a href="Commands.html">templating</a> tutorial you'll see an example of how to create your own
    <em>flower()</em> command for example.</p>
